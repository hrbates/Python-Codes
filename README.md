# Python-Codes
These are the python codes that were used to create the properties plots, light curves, and HR diagrams


Any python code ending in _weak plots the various densities that were created with electron capture.

Any python code ending in _1e9 plots the rho_0 = 1e9 both with and without electron capture against each other.

Any python code ending in _ONEMG plots the O, Ne, Mg white dwarf and C, O white dwarf both with and without electron capture (for rho_0 = 1e9)

Any other python code is for for the various densities, but without electron capture.


HR refers to creating an HR diagram.

The light curve codes show how long they will plot.

The props code plots the following properties: T_9, density, chemical potential (short term), chemical potential (longer term), velocity, pressure, Ye, and entropy per nucleon.
